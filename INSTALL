This directory contains zabbix MySQL loadable module, which extends
functionality of the Zabbix Agent.

Included build framework immplemened full software package maintenance cycle
of source code consisting from:

- building binary files on development stage
- final verification before release and package source tar ball
- building rpm package straight from source tar ball
- automatic embedding installed rpm package into configuration of the main
  Zabbix packages

To build it you need to have the following rpm packages installed:

- autoconf
- automake
- gcc
- glibc-devel
- pkgconfig
- rpm-build
- xz
- zabbix-devel

Description of steps necessary to:
- prepare source code tree build automation:

autoreconf -fiv

- compile module:

./configure <params>; make

- install:

make install [DESTDIR=<install_prefix>]

- generate clean tested distribution source tar ball:

make distcheck

- generate rpm packages (binary and source as well) from generated tar ball

rpmbuild -ta zbx_mod_mysql-<version>.tar.xz

- install generated package 

rpm -Uvh zbx_mod_mysql-<version>-1.<arch>.rpm

If you want to publish generated package(s) into an rpm repository you need to
install the anaconda package which will provide zbx_mod_mysql package.
You need to create a directory to store the binary package and
afterwards to copy the rpm file into it you must update your repository indexes by:

createrepo <repo_directory>

It is good to create <repo_directory>/old directory and move after
release of the new package old binary packages to <repo_directory>/old
directory to hold in single repo current and older packages.
To upgrade package on systems which have registered in dnf/yum repo you
need to execute:

yum upgrade zbx_mod_mysql

or:

dnf upgrade zbx_mod_mysql

As long as new and previous package will be in the same repository if anything will
be wrong with upgraded package availability as long as older binary package
is indexed by repository all what is really necessary to execute is:

yum downgrade zbx_mod_mysql

or:

dnf downgrade zbx_mod_mysql

RPM package has registered LoadModule=zbx_mod_mysql.so configuration file
which will be installed in <sysconfdir>/zabbix_agentd.d directory. If
zabbix_agentd.conf file has uncommented line like:

Include=<sysconfdir>/zabbix_agentd.d

this configuration file will be automatically added to agent configuration
so no manual operations will be needed to update agent setup.
